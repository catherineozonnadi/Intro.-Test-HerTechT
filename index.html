            I've always wanted to be the kind of person who radiates positivity
            and joy, and I've come to realize that gratitude is the key to
            unlocking that mindset. So, I've made it my mission to cultivate a
            sense of gratitude in my daily life. <br /><br />
            I started by keeping a gratitude journal, where I write down three
            things I'm thankful for each day. It's amazing how this simple
            practice has shifted my focus away from stress and anxiety and
            towards the good things in my life. <br />
            I'm also making a conscious effort to express my gratitude to
            others, whether it's a kind word, a text message, or a small gift. I
            want to be the kind of person who lifts others up and makes them
            feel seen and appreciated.

            <br /><br />
            As I continue on this journey, I'm learning that gratitude is a
            muscle that needs to be exercised regularly. Some days it comes
            easily, while others it's a struggle. But I'm determined to keep at
            it, because I know that the more I practice gratitude, the more it
            will become a part of who I am. My goal is to become a person who
            embodies gratitude and spreads joy to those around me. It's a
            journey, not a destination, and I'm excited to see where it takes
            me.

              right there with <br> the characters, experiencing everything they
              did.
              And i loved the diversity of <br> the characters and the

                The world-building in this novel is incredible! I felt like I

                they
                did. Though, I'm still reeling <br> from the ending. It's been
                days since I finished the book, and I can't stop <br> thinking
                about it.
